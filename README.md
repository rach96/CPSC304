Hello Everyone!
Here is where we will be working on the code for our Gymnasium database

Division of Labour:
  - We will all plan out the big picture of our application together - see below!
  - Tiffany and Joy will populate the database
  - Andy will be creating the GUI
  - Rachel and Joy will be coding the query for customer
  - Tiffany will be coding the query for employee
  - Andy will be coding tables that can be generated by employees (ie, monthly membership expiration table etc.)


Big Picture of Application:
- Write your ideas here!
Rachel:
Interface where customers need to log in first after being approved by an admin (Employee)
Home Page, Page with rates on it, Hours of Operation, Reserve Page and Check-in Page, Contact us page?
  - Home page:
  - Reserve page: drop down menus with equipment, times (drop down or select?), price correlated with the time and equipment
  - Check-in page:insert reservation number and client ID maybe
  - Account page: list information about address, phone number, etc

extra fancy
